"""

This module holds the base class for the instrument defaults.
This is an abstract class which will need to be overwritten
for each beamline.  This design was chosen because the
subclass cannot be instantiated unless all of the abstract methods
have been implemented.  This means that we detect mistakes in the
subclass the moment that the Defaults object is created, instead of
in the middle of a user run when a missing method is called.
